Cho-Han is a traditional Japanese gambling game using dice.
The game uses two standard six-sided duce, which are shaken in a bamboo cup or bowl by a dealer. The cup is then
overturned onto the floor. Players then place their wagers on whether the sum total of numbers showing on the two dice
will be Cho (even) or Han (odd). The dealer then removes the cup, displaying the dice. The winners collect their money.
